        <h4>Avoid Maximizing Your Charge Cycles.</h4>
        
        <p>As per information from <a href="https://www.apple.com/batteries/why-lithium-ion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple</a>, iPhones tend to retain only up to 80% of their original battery capacity after approximately 500 charge cycles. A charge cycle is completed when the entirety of the iPhone's battery is used upâ€”for instance, using 50% yesterday and another 50% today.</p>
        
        <p>In general, minimizing iPhone usage results in fewer charge cycles, thereby extending the overall battery lifespan. You can assess <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/check-iphone-battery-cycle-count/">the number of battery cycles your iPhone has undergone</a> without requiring a dedicated app.</p>
        
        <p>It's essential to note that maintaining the device at a constant full charge or allowing it to completely drain can have adverse effects on the iPhone's battery health. Therefore, it's advisable to maintain your device's battery level between 40% and 80% whenever possible to preserve the longevity of your iPhone's battery.</p>
