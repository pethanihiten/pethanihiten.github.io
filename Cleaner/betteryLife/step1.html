        <h4>Limit When and How Often Apps Access Your Location</h4>
        
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.apple.com/batteries/why-lithium-ion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple</a>, after roughly 500 charge cycles, iPhones retain only up to 80% of their original battery capacity. You go through a charge cycle when you use up 100% of your iPhone's batteryâ€”for example, you used up 50% yesterday and another 50% today.</p>
        
        <p>So, in general, the less you use your iPhone, the fewer charge cycles you go through and the longer the battery will last. You can check <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/check-iphone-battery-cycle-count/">how many battery cycles your iPhone has gone through</a> without even using an app.</p>
        
        <p>Moreover, keeping the device at full charge or completely drained can negatively impact your iPhone's battery health. For this reason, you should try to keep your device between 40% and 80% battery as much as possible to preserve your iPhone's battery health.</p>
